### Updates
- Otc 9, 2016
  * The code and training prototxt for our [ECCV16](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46478-7_31) paper are released.

### Files
- Original Caffe library
- Center Loss
  * src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
  * include/caffe/layers/center_loss_layer.hpp
  * src/caffe/layers/center_loss_layer.cpp
  * src/caffe/layers/center_loss_layer.cu
- face_example
  * face_example/data/
  * face_example/face_snapshot/
  * face_example/face_train_test.prototxt
  * face_example/face_solver.prototxt
  * face_example/face_deploy.prototxt

### Usage
- Make sure you have correctly installed [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) before using our code. Please follow the [installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).
- Download the face dataset for training, e.g. [CAISA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html), [MS-Celeb-1M](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ms-celeb-1m-challenge-recognizing-one-million-celebrities-real-world/), [MegaFace](http://megaface.cs.washington.edu/).
- Preprocess the training face images, including detection, alignment, etc. Here we strongly recommend [MTCNN](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment), which is an effective and efficient open-source tool for face detection and alignment.
- Creat list for training set and validation set. Place them in face_example/data/
- Specify your data source for train & val

        layer {
          name: "data"
          type: "ImageData"
          top: "data"
          top: "label"
          image_data_param {
            source: "face_example/data/###your_list###"
          }
        }
- Specify the number of subject in FC6 layer

        layer {
          name: "fc6"
          type: "InnerProduct"
          bottom: "fc5"
          top: "fc6"
          inner_product_param {
            num_output: ##number##
          }
        }
- Specify the loss weight and the number of subject in center loss layer

        layer {
          name: "center_loss"
          type: "CenterLoss"
          bottom: "fc5"
          bottom: "label"
          top: "center_loss"
          loss_weight: ##weight##
          center_loss_param {
            num_output: ##number##
          }
        }

- Run the model

        cd $CAFFE-FACE_ROOT
        ./build/tools/caffe train -solver face_example/face_solver.prototxt -gpu X,Y

- Please refer to our ECCV paper and code for more details.

# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like
